Create an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer randomly chooses an option. The game displays the result—whether the user wins, loses, or draws—and updates the scores accordingly. Players can reset the game to start over.
HTML structures the interface, CSS styles it for an appealing look, and JavaScript handles the game logic, including user input, computer selection, scorekeeping, and result display. Save the code in index.html, styles.css, and script.js, then open the HTML file in a browser to play.
